-vec <vec_file_name> : Name of the output file containing the positive samples for training.
-img <image_file_name> : Source object image (e.g., a company logo).
-bg <background_file_name> : Background description file; contains a list of images which are used as a background for randomly distorted versions of the object.
-num <number_of_samples> : Number of positive samples to generate.
-bgcolor <background_color> : Background color (currently grayscale images are assumed); the background color denotes the transparent color. Since there might be compression artifacts, the amount of color tolerance can be specified by -bgthresh. All pixels withing bgcolor-bgthresh and bgcolor+bgthresh range are interpreted as transparent.
-bgthresh <background_color_threshold>
-inv : If specified, colors will be inverted.
-randinv : If specified, colors will be inverted randomly.
-maxidev <max_intensity_deviation> : Maximal intensity deviation of pixels in foreground samples.
-maxxangle <max_x_rotation_angle> : Maximal rotation angle towards x-axis, must be given in radians.
-maxyangle <max_y_rotation_angle> : Maximal rotation angle towards y-axis, must be given in radians.
-maxzangle <max_z_rotation_angle> : Maximal rotation angle towards z-axis, must be given in radians.
-show : Useful debugging option. If specified, each sample will be shown. Pressing Esc will continue the samples creation process without showing each sample.
-w <sample_width> : Width (in pixels) of the output samples.
-h <sample_height> : Height (in pixels) of the output samples.
