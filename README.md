# trafficSignalProcessing

Paths need to modified to point to your local repository and directory heirarchy.

opencv 3 needs to be installed as a pre-requisite.

This project is intended to create a highly efficient cascaded classifier using opensource technologies, modules and datasets available for realtime traffic detection and switching the traffic signals in the most effecient way possible.

This is still in development phase so the code might not be completely functional.

List of all the additional modules required would be updated soon.
